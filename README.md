## Key Features

- **Zero External Dependencies**: Built entirely in Java, CacheBox requires no additional libraries.
- **File-Based Persistence**: Data is automatically saved to disk, ensuring durability across sessions.
- **Multi-Type Support**: Store and retrieve data in various formats, including String, Integer, Boolean, List, and Null.
- **Advanced Search**: Perform complex queries with pattern matching, range searches, and type filtering.
- **Interactive CLI**: A user-friendly command-line interface for managing your data.
- **Encryption Support**: Secure your data with AES, XOR, or no encryption strategies.
- **Sharding and Load Balancing**: Distribute data across multiple shards for better performance.
- **Real-Time Monitoring**: Track performance metrics and visualize data with live monitoring.
- **Data Validation**: Ensure data integrity with custom validation rules and type constraints.
- **Network Interface and Server**: Run CacheBox as a server with a custom CBSP protocol for networked access.

## Getting Started

### Installation

To use CacheBox, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/enmanokatana/CacheBoxDb.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd cachebox
   ```

3. Build the project using Maven:

   ```bash
   mvn clean package
   ```

4. Navigate to the scripts directory:

   ```bash
   cd scripts
   ```

5. Start the CLI or server mode depending on your use case:

   - To start the CLI:
     ```bash
     ./start-cli
     ```
   - To start the server:
     ```bash
     ./start-server
     ```

---

### Quick Start

#### Using the CLI

1. Start the CacheBox CLI:

   ```bash
   ./start-cli
   ```

2. Follow the on-screen instructions to interact with the database.

#### Example Commands

- **Store a value**:

  ```bash
  db> put string name John
  ```

- **Retrieve a value**:

  ```bash
  db> get name
  ```

- **Search for values**:

  ```bash
  db> search -pattern "J.*"
  ```

- **Enable encryption**:

  ```bash
  db> encrypt enable
  ```

---

### Using the Server

CacheBox also supports a server mode for networked access. Start the server with:

```bash
./start-server
```

The server listens on port `20029` by default. You can interact with it using the provided client or custom scripts.

---

## Advanced Features

### Search Functionality

CacheBox supports advanced search queries with the following options:

- **Pattern Matching**: Use regular expressions to search keys or values.
- **Range Queries**: Filter numeric values within a specified range.
- **Type Filtering**: Restrict results to specific data types (e.g., String, Integer).
- **Staged vs. Committed**: Search only staged (uncommitted) or committed data.

#### Example Commands

```bash
db> search -pattern "na.*"
db> search -range 10 50
db> search -type string
db> search -staged
db> search -committed
```

---

### Encryption

CacheBox supports encryption for data at rest. You can enable encryption, set encryption algorithms (AES, XOR, or no encryption), and manage encryption keys.

#### Example Commands

```bash
db> encrypt enable
db> encrypt set_algorithm AES
db> encrypt set_key my16bytekey
db> encrypt generate_key
```

---

### Sharding and Load Balancing

CacheBox supports sharding and load balancing across multiple cache boxes. The `ShardedCacheBox` class manages multiple shards, and the `LoadBalancer` distributes requests across these shards.

---

### Real-Time Monitoring

CacheBox provides real-time performance monitoring and snapshot metrics. You can start live monitoring or take a snapshot of the current performance metrics.

#### Example Commands

```bash
db> snapshot_performance
db> live_performance
db> stop_lp
```

---

## Network Interface and Server

### CBSP Protocol

CacheBox includes a custom **CBSP (CacheBox Serialization Protocol)** for communication between the server and clients. The CBSP protocol is designed to be simple and efficient, supporting the following operations:

- **PUT**: Store a value in the database.
- **GET**: Retrieve a value by key.
- **DELETE**: Remove a key-value pair.
- **SEARCH**: Perform advanced queries.
- **PING**: Check server availability.

#### Example CBSP Request

```
*3
$3
PUT
$4
name
$4
John
```

#### Example CBSP Response

```
+OK
```

### Server Mode

The CacheBox server runs on port `20029` and supports multiple client connections. It uses a thread pool to handle concurrent requests efficiently.

#### Starting the Server

```bash
./start-server
```

#### Example Client Interaction

You can interact with the server using a custom client or tools like `telnet`:

```bash
telnet localhost 20029
```

## Best Practices

1. **Key Naming**: Use consistent naming conventions and avoid special characters.
2. **Data Types**: Use appropriate data types for values and handle null values explicitly.
3. **Operations**: Check value types before operations and handle exceptions appropriately.
4. **Search Queries**: Use patterns, ranges, and type filtering for structured searches.
5. **Encryption**: Use encryption for sensitive data and manage keys securely.
6. **Sharding**: Distribute data across multiple shards for better performance and scalability.
7. **Monitoring**: Regularly monitor performance and take snapshots for analysis.
