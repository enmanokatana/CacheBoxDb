     ```
   - **Retrieve a Value**:
     ```bash
     db> get name
     ```
   - **Search for Values**:
     ```bash
     db> search -pattern "J.*"
     ```
   - **Enable Encryption**:
     ```bash
     db> encrypt enable
     ```

  db> search -pattern "na.*"
  ```
- **Range Queries**:
  ```bash
  db> search -range 10 50
  ```
- **Type Filtering**:
  ```bash
  db> search -type string
  ```
- **Staged vs. Committed**:
  ```bash
  db> search -staged
  db> search -committed
  ```

### Encryption
